    <h2>Ideation</h2>
     <p> My keyword is migrating. It is intially describing massive people or wild animals moving from one place to another. During the study from home, the usage of VPN inspired me - is this a form of virtual migrating? People trying to change their digital position (via use VPN) to get access to the digital/online information and resources from some certain district or area.

     <h2>Reflections</h2>
     <p> I think I should put more thoughts into the loop animation in this project. Think about relationship among the speed, the amount and the wall sealing up process. And when some district is idle for a long time, the wall might naturally vanished. Think more about the logic of the process? And also how to choose appropriate materials and texutures to simulate the vpn, the wall, the migrating process? What's be migrated along with the virtual address? Data? Image?
