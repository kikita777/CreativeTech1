        <div class="quotes">
            <h4>Setup My Altar</h4>
             <p>For this week, I started to build the scene in the Unity3D and combine it with OBS virtual camera. It is with regret that I hadn't thought of a specific concept about my altar. Thus mainly what I did it filled up my space with my "secondaries"(maybe that's my point - familiar but unimportant things floating and jumping around me - somehow digitally display the intimacy I have with my surroudings happening in real environment) <br>1st attempt</p>

             <p>I added animations to the flowers and the candle models, So they are jumping and repeating in front of me - like my loyal guardians. And other stuffs floating and rotating in the area.</p>
             <p>Final Version</p>

             <p>I think this series of technologies is a powerful strategy to be applied into various digital practices. And also worth to think about the relationship between physical and digital objects through these open ended experiments.</p>

        <h2>WEEK 4</h2>
        <div class="quotes">
           <h4>Step into Photogrammetry</h4>
            <p>For the week4, We started to use Metashape to scan our objects and create their digital twins. At very initial step, I misunderstood the photoing process - only took photos of the object at the same flat. Plus, I was really bad at managing the distance between my phone and object, so the dense cloud looked really chaotic.\n My first try:<br></p>

            <p>After practiced several times, I became more experienced at taking good photo collection. So here are more photogrammetry I made:<br></p>
