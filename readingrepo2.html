            <p class=quote>&quot In this, the art of reading hardly differs from the art of writing, in that its most intense pleasures and pains must remain private, and cannot be communicated to others. Our secret affinities remain secret even to ourselves ..we fall in love with certain works of art, as we fall in love with certain individuals, for no very clear motive. &quot</p> 
            <p> This reminds me of aesthetic experience. People experience the art of reading for the art of writing, their mental state might be shifted. That leads to certain kind of intimacy, which is indescribable, unspeakable, and unable to be completely or 100% accurately conveyed through language. And that distance also contribute to this personal aesthetic experience.

            <p class=quote>&quot However, given the scale of operations at Cronus Corp., even a tiny rate of error would likely be amplified beyond what the researchers and the interested companies may consider to be negligible levels  &quot </p>
            <p> I do believe a lot of decisions on how the project or product should be designed need the thought and consideration from all angles of a company. We cannot only relying on designers or engineers but also we should have the board room got involved into this decision making process. Also thinking about the giant companies except for what products they are publishing to the market, what kind of values are they sharing and conveying through their advertisement or public behaviors.

            <p class=quote>&quot Epimetheus’ engineers had designed the app to do good. Even if it also produced some harmful side effects, the intention was to create something that would benefit society by increasing knowledge &quot</p>
            <p> A lot of cases in this series actually mentioned a lot about when the researchers or the engineers has designed the project or the app to do good, but still the project might have some harmful side effects. Thus I am wondering how should we think of the responsibilities in this situation. I believe that when some harm happened to certain users, the blame cannot be avoided or neglected no matter what's the company's initial aim or purpose. It's really a big challenge for companies to think of how to integrate and optimize their products or project before they are truly  coming to the market.

            <p class=quote>&quot The common thread seems to be that if data comes from humans, it will likely have bias in it. &quot</p> 
            <p> This is so ironic.. But definitely we can not deny that so many biases had become transparent fused in our culture or common sense. We are easily to take it as granted or normal way of society functioning until we become the one who encounter the bias or the discrimination. Even sometimes we are put onto that spot, we hardly notice the tragedy is happening on ourselves since we just think it is how the society running. How to recognized the invisible and pull it out from the system, is harder than ever, but also the mission we can not escape from.

            <p class=quote>&quot Since humans tend to be biased, the algorithms that learn from them will also tend to be biased unless humans take extra care to find and remove the bias.  &quot </p>
            <p> Since in this article, author discussed so much about the AI taking shortcut to finish their tasks. Bias might also be the shortcut for human. In that case taking extra care to find and remove the bias is not really “extra”. It is necessity. It is basic routine for a non-biased algorithm. For such a long time, we've get used to the shortcut thus the road is deserted, which needs efforts and time to rehabilitate.

            <p class=quote>&quot When they looked to see what parts of the image their AI was using to identify the tench, it showed them that it was looking for human fingers against a green background. &quot</p>
            <p>Sometimes it is people who misleading the AI, but obviously, what AI is thinking about somehow can not be 100% understood or predicted. That also led to the question about how we build our data set. What hidden or extra information is given in the collection - which can be utilized by AI?

            <p class=quote>&quot Digital products are displayed on screens of different sizes and with dynamic content. Digital products allow users to interact with their content, and take advantage of motion and animation.Furthermore, digital products often have temporal logic where a linear narrative is replaced by a set of complex states and transitions. &quot
            </p> 
            <p>From this quote, there are several characteristics of digital products mentioned, like different sizes, dynamic content, interact, motion and animation, temporal logic, non-linear narrative”. And all of those characteristics are created since digital products are developed with programming languages. This reminds me of how the physical products display their own narrative and the layout which is statistic, linear narrative. Furthermore if we discussed deeper about the visualization of physical products, especially from a  cultural aspect -this kind of statistic visualization is always under one certain culture frame of reference. Thus, give us the inspiration that how can digital products be displayed cross-culturally or can be changeable to fit the different colors your frame of reference. Also understand how certain culture background solid the foundation of the uses’ preferences on the interaction with or the usage of digital products.

            <p class=quote>&quot By changing the size, you can make that hill longer, continuing outside the canvas. By changing the position of the rectangle, you can create asymmetric whitespace, making sure that the user notices the rectangle. &quot
            </p>
            <p>I really like the example sketch the author demonstrated here. Though it's a very simple and standardized rectangle - a most common shape, through the rotation and size changing it can also be turned into a totally different abstract thing which can be recognized by the readers. But what I want to critique here is that when authors say “it became a hill”, it requires readers or audience to have certain pre-knowledge about the simplified visualization system to understand this kind of implications. Thus, it's the challenge for the designers or the programmers to reconsider the universality and understand ability of the digital products.

            <p class=quote>&quot The star below is created by alternating between a low and a high radius for each vertex. It's easy to tweak the style of the star by using different numbers or more vertices, or using rotate()  to change the orientation of the star.
                 &quot
            </p>
            <p>We can actually see a lot of difference between drawing a shape using hand and using programming language.  Here is using the vertex under the ’if-else’ condition, to position the vertex at intervals. Then the area that is generated by connecting those vertex as the outside frame will be filled with color. But in daily life when we are drawing a star using our hands we are more possibly to draw it using one touch drawing. Go with the lines, neglecting they are crossing each other’s. Then we might still use repeititive lines to fill the blank area. The logics behind two different approaches for drawing a star are quite different.
