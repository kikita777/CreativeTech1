            <p class=quote>&quot Digital products are displayed on screens of different sizes and with dynamic content. Digital products allow users to interact with their content, and take advantage of motion and animation.Furthermore, digital products often have temporal logic where a linear narrative is replaced by a set of complex states and transitions. &quot
            </p> 
            <p>From this quote, there are several characteristics of digital products mentioned, like different sizes, dynamic content, interact, motion and animation, temporal logic, non-linear narrative”. And all of those characteristics are created since digital products are developed with programming languages. This reminds me of how the physical products display their own narrative and the layout which is statistic, linear narrative. Furthermore if we discussed deeper about the visualization of physical products, especially from a  cultural aspect -this kind of statistic visualization is always under one certain culture frame of reference. Thus, give us the inspiration that how can digital products be displayed cross-culturally or can be changeable to fit the different colors your frame of reference. Also understand how certain culture background solid the foundation of the uses’ preferences on the interaction with or the usage of digital products.

            <p class=quote>&quot By changing the size, you can make that hill longer, continuing outside the canvas. By changing the position of the rectangle, you can create asymmetric whitespace, making sure that the user notices the rectangle. &quot
            </p>
            <p>I really like the example sketch the author demonstrated here. Though it's a very simple and standardized rectangle - a most common shape, through the rotation and size changing it can also be turned into a totally different abstract thing which can be recognized by the readers. But what I want to critique here is that when authors say “it became a hill”, it requires readers or audience to have certain pre-knowledge about the simplified visualization system to understand this kind of implications. Thus, it's the challenge for the designers or the programmers to reconsider the universality and understand ability of the digital products.

            <p class=quote>&quot The star below is created by alternating between a low and a high radius for each vertex. It's easy to tweak the style of the star by using different numbers or more vertices, or using rotate()  to change the orientation of the star.
                 &quot
            </p>
            <p>We can actually see a lot of difference between drawing a shape using hand and using programming language.  Here is using the vertex under the ’if-else’ condition, to position the vertex at intervals. Then the area that is generated by connecting those vertex as the outside frame will be filled with color. But in daily life when we are drawing a star using our hands we are more possibly to draw it using one touch drawing. Go with the lines, neglecting they are crossing each other’s. Then we might still use repeititive lines to fill the blank area. The logics behind two different approaches for drawing a star are quite different.
