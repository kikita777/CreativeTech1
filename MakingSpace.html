             <p>A making space where physical personal profile is made.</n>
 
                Perfect matchmaking is not easy everywhere. The process might be even more complicated in traditional Chinese culture. Young couples are facing the dilemma in individual choice and parent involvement. The relationship between couple is usually extended beyond two people and widely influences larger family issues.</n>
                
                How can a perfect match be made?</n>
                What standards are deciding the potential candidate?</n>
                What the "perfect" means in relationship or matchmaking?</n>
                How can daily objects be relevant to our individual identity?</n>
                
                I speculated an alternative way for matchmaking - object-oriented experience, by imagining a matchmaking company which provides physical profile making service. Here, professional agents help people reassembly their daily objects and personal trashes to build their customized profile cases.<br>1st attempt</p>
