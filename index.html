    <p>Spark AR Studio is an augmented reality platform for Mac & Windows that allows you to somewhat easily create AR effects for mobile cameras. Think of it like Photoshop or Sketch, but for AR.</p>

    <p>Basically, PowerPoint is a presentation program developed by Microsoft. However, I saw one of my friends use this to do more creative thing beyond slide.</p>

<h2>3 Quotes & Responds  </h2>
<div class="quotes">
    <p class=quote>&quot Open design, particularly in regards to <span>digital hardware and software</span> heralds new possibilities for artists, scholars and interested citizens to engage more fully in a simultaneously conceptual and material critique of technologies and information systems in society. &quot
    </p><br>
    <p>Nowadays our daily lifes are profoudly influenced by and closely related to digital hardware and software. However in the traditional industries, these works are mostly developed by the expertises, which means the further impact and implication of their developments, reflecting on the society, might be despised, or even neglected. The joint effort from multi-disciplinaries and the wider public, can reassess the previews works - trying to erase bias, inequality - which may led to better design in our digital era.
    </p><br><br><br>
    <p class=quote>&quot I call this work ‘critical making’ in order to highlight the reconnection of two modes of engagement with the world that are typically held separate: critical thinking, traditionally understood as conceptually and linguistically based, and physical ‘making’, goal-based material work. I see this as a necessary integration for a variety of reasons: first, as a way of overcoming the ‘brittle’ and overly structural sense of technologies that often exists in critical social science literature... &quot
    </p><br>
    <p> Just highly agree with reason1!! 
    </p><br><br><br>
    <p class=quote>&quot What differentiates critical making is its attention to the interwoven social and technical aspects of modern life – what theorists call the <span>socio-technical</span>  – rather than being primarily about technical expertise or functional knowledge about the natural world. &quot
    </p><br>
    <p>When I started to know something about critical design and speculative design, I tried to make some physical props to build up my scenarios. However, as these design being "dealing with the aesthetics of the use of new technologies in the context of electric"(from Introduction to Speculative Design Practice), seems that it is difficult for us to put technologies aside. Trying to use them as a medium/approach in the design practices seems becoming inevitably important.
