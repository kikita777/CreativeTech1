    <h3>From: THE PRESENCE PROJECT</h3>
    <div class="quotes">
        <p class=quote>&quot Our research into the legality of broadcasting sounds of the countryside over FM frequencies in Italy had been frustrating and inconclusive. Attempts to locate the relevant authorities over the month before we travelled had been unsuccessful, despite the help of a native Italian to guide and translate for us... But the situation in Italy was unclear. It seemed that either anything was legal, or nothing was. Given that our tests would take place only over a day or two, in a fairly remote village, we decided to risk detection and proceed with the trials  &quot
        </p><br>
        <p> Reading this paragraph actually made me really nervous and curious about what’s gonna happen later, in which case I started to imagine how people in this project, at that moment, are feeling. And all the challenges and difficulties mentioned in this chapter triggered me to think about what kind of methodology or strategy we should take in field experiments. Define the key point of the testing? Adjust the emphasis timely and appropriately? How to minimize or manage the risks?
        </p><br><br><br>
        <p class=quote>&quot Our calls remained unanswered. People ignored the ringing phones, and if they did answer soon hung up. With several of our team observing the phone booths we were by now targeting directly, we realised that the phones were only answered when somebody was in the booth about to make a call anyway. &quot
        </p><br> 
        <p>Experiments, which need public or citizens get involved, seem more likely to be unpredictable and unsure. Sometimes we might have the prediction about how people are reacting to our work, thus we are designing or arranging our work in this way - while in the end people just go the reverse way. I feel this is quite a challenge for everyone trying to do these kind of public experiments. But I do appreciate how people in this project are trying to figure out the potential elements influencing the responses, and then trying to switch to a better solution to test if it works better. Though this Digital Boudoir is claimed as “almost complete failure”, the process of the experiment and the reason for failure are still thought provoking.
        </p><br><br><br>
        <p class=quote>&quot Standing near large coat racks hung with cards making various statements soon made us feel uncomfortably exposed. We found ourselves embarrassed by some of the slogans. They seemed the product of religious fanaticism (‘treat others as you would like to be treated’), crude political protest (‘people ignore us in the Bijlmer’), or of a naive vulnerability (‘I am afraid’). We began to realise that the best slogans were slightly ambiguous or detached in tone (‘I am from another country’), or were particular and personal statements (‘I like a few drinks once in a while’). These seemed to escape classification into known forms of public display, invoking curiosity and imagination rather than immediate dismissal. &quot
        </p><br>
        <p> When I saw the images attached later, I realized this statements were truly displayed as obvious and powerful slogans. Through the embarrassment, I started to inspect  how the directness or the ambiguity embedded in the slogans are influencing the perceptions, feeling and reaction from the audience( or passerby here ). In some way, the directness shrinks the distance between the content and the audience, by strongly expressed emotion or honestly unfolded standpoint. While the ambiguity in these slogans, are more like bait, waiting for audience hooked and expanding their imagination or suspicion. There is a detour between the contents and the audience.

    <h2>3 Quotes & Responds  </h2>
    <h3>From: What do Prototypes Prototype?</h3>
    <div class="quotes">
        <p class=quote>&quot Prototypes provide the means for examining design problems and evaluating solutions.  Selecting the focus of a prototype is the art of identifying the most important open design questions. &quot
        </p><br>
        <p>The author gave a rough model of what prototypes prototype - role, implemention, look and feel, which I found quite useful applying into my future design process. In my past experience, especially when I'm working with multi-disciplinaries, I might face the difficults to convey my ideation correctly or accurately. I feel like how to identify the most important question also determined on who are you talking to (which author also mentioned in the artitle). For example, if I'm communicating with the technologist, i might use storyboard(more like a "role" prototype) or a simple mockup. If we are showing our ideas to teachers(they are mostly engineering background), we might make a "implemention" prototype focus on explaining how we develop or run our project. And during the visit to FROG DESIGN SHANGHAI last month, I got to know that they also make a lot of prototype for internal discussion，discussion with clients，or with customers. They may make several prototypes at the same time, with different people involved - designers in different field, design technologists...
        </p><br><br><br>
        <p class=quote>&quot Is a brick a prototype?  The answer depends on how it is used.  If it is used to represent the weight and scale of some future artifact, then it certainly is: it prototypes the weight and scale of the artifact. &quot
        </p><br>
        <p>This is the part I didn't expect - a brick as a prototype. Also similar examples mentioned later - storyboard as prototype and even pizza box as prototype. These examples vivdly show how significant for a designer to correctly, accurately use tools or medias to explore or demonstrate the "artifacts".
        </p><br><br><br>
        <p class=quote>&quot Implementation prototypes can be hard to build, and since they actually work, it is common for them to find their way directly into the final system. &quot
        </p><br>
        <p> That's what I'm thinking about!! I feel like a implemention prototype is more like a initial version of the artifact(or project in my preview experience), and seems it is already in the half way of the accomplishment and the team just need to do more iteration and testing.

    <h2>3 Quotes & Responds  </h2>
    <h3>From: The Hacker Hacked</h3>
    <div class="quotes">
        <p class=quote>&quot The internet promises open access to information and online assembly for individual computer owners. At the same time, it serves as <span>a tool for corporate monopolists and government surveillance</span>. &quot
        </p><br>
        <p>Totally agree with this point of view. And I do believe this is what's happening in our daily life. Chinese government are using the health code, which is generated from people‘s medical records, travel history and even more personal information, during the pandemic. This special form of surviliance and regulation seems be normalized after several months‘ education. Showing the code（maybe goes far beyond the health) will be regarded as obligation to maintain the safety and stablity of the society. Privacy will compromise with the public interest.
        </p><br><br><br>
        <p class=quote>&quot Hackers believe that essential lessons can be learned about the systems –about the world – from <span>taking things apart</span>, seeing how they work, and using this knowledge to create new and even more interesting things. &quot
        </p><br>
        <p>I feel like this is also one of the Methodologies in design field. Dig deeper into the object, system, behavior and then deconstruct them，to figure out what‘s behind, what's inside them. And then the knowledge, rules, principles, conditions can be applied on your own designing process - to rebuilt object, system, behavior.
        </p><br><br><br>
        <p class=quote>&quot The search for <span>unusual detours</span> – through a sewer system, for example – is exhilarating because you see things that you’re not supposed to be interested in. Your curiosity takes you to places where you don’t belong. It thus becomes <span>an assertion of individual defiance of social norms</span>. The byproduct of such exploration is <span>pragmatic knowledge, the disruption of standard patterns of thought, and also dealienatio – you see what’s behind the interfaces that surround us, coming closer to the reality of our social worldn</span>. &quot
        </p><br>
        <p>I really love it when author is using &quotdetours&quot, &quotbyproduct&quot during the discussion. I feel like these elements are compositing a negative space for our society - which is about the unspeakables, the invisibles, the untouchables behind our social norms. From there we generate what people think as &quotnew&quot, &quotinspirational&quot, &quotgenius&quot.

<h2>3 Quotes & Responds  </h2>
<h3>From: Critical Making</h3>
<div class="quotes">
    <p class=quote>&quot Open design, particularly in regards to <span>digital hardware and software</span> heralds new possibilities for artists, scholars and interested citizens to engage more fully in a simultaneously conceptual and material critique of technologies and information systems in society. &quot
    </p><br>
    <p>Nowadays our daily lifes are profoudly influenced by and closely related to digital hardware and software. However in the traditional industries, these works are mostly developed by the expertises, which means the further impact and implication of their developments, reflecting on the society, might be despised, or even neglected. The joint effort from multi-disciplinaries and the wider public, can reassess the previews works - trying to erase bias, inequality - which may led to better design in our digital era.
    </p><br><br><br>
    <p class=quote>&quot I call this work ‘critical making’ in order to highlight the reconnection of two modes of engagement with the world that are typically held separate: critical thinking, traditionally understood as conceptually and linguistically based, and physical ‘making’, goal-based material work. I see this as a necessary integration for a variety of reasons: first, as a way of overcoming the ‘brittle’ and overly structural sense of technologies that often exists in critical social science literature... &quot
    </p><br>
    <p> Just highly agree with reason1!! 
    </p><br><br><br>
    <p class=quote>&quot What differentiates critical making is its attention to the interwoven social and technical aspects of modern life – what theorists call the <span>socio-technical</span>  – rather than being primarily about technical expertise or functional knowledge about the natural world. &quot
    </p><br>
    <p>When I started to know something about critical design and speculative design, I tried to make some physical props to build up my scenarios. However, as these design being "dealing with the aesthetics of the use of new technologies in the context of electric"(from Introduction to Speculative Design Practice), seems that it is difficult for us to put technologies aside. Trying to use them as a medium/approach in the design practices seems becoming inevitably important.
