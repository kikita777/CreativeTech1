    <h2>3 Quotes & Responds  </h2>
    <div class="quotes">
        <p class=quote>&quot The internet promises open access to information and online assembly for individual computer owners. At the same time, it serves as <span>a tool for corporate monopolists and government surveillance</span>. &quot
        </p><br>
        <p>Totally agree with this point of view. And I do believe this is what's happening in our daily life. Chinese government are using the health code, which is generated from people‘s medical records, travel history and even more personal information, during the pandemic. This special form of surviliance and regulation seems be normalized after several months‘ education. Showing the code（maybe goes far beyond the health) will be regarded as obligation to maintain the safety and stablity of the society. Privacy will compromise with the public interest.
        </p><br><br><br>
        <p class=quote>&quot Hackers believe that essential lessons can be learned about the systems –about the world – from <span>taking things apart</span>, seeing how they work, and using this knowledge to create new and even more interesting things. &quot
        </p><br>
        <p>I feel like this is also one of the Methodologies in design field. Dig deeper into the object, system, behavior and then deconstruct them，to figure out what‘s behind, what's inside them. And then the knowledge, rules, principles, conditions can be applied on your own designing process - to rebuilt object, system, behavior.
        </p><br><br><br>
        <p class=quote>&quot The search for <span>unusual detours</span> – through a sewer system, for example – is exhilarating because you see things that you’re not supposed to be interested in. Your curiosity takes you to places where you don’t belong. It thus becomes <span>an assertion of individual defiance of social norms</span>. The byproduct of such exploration is <span>pragmatic knowledge, the disruption of standard patterns of thought, and also dealienatio – you see what’s behind the interfaces that surround us, coming closer to the reality of our social worldn</span>. &quot
        </p><br>
        <p>I really love it when author is using &quotdetours&quot, &quotbyproduct&quot during the discussion. I feel like these elements are compositing a negative space for our society - which is about the unspeakables, the invisibles, the untouchables behind our social norms. From there we generate what people think as &quotnew&quot, &quotinspirational&quot, &quotgenius&quot.

    <p>Spark AR Studio is an augmented reality platform for Mac & Windows that allows you to somewhat easily create AR effects for mobile cameras. Think of it like Photoshop or Sketch, but for AR.</p>

<h2>3 Quotes & Responds  </h2>
<div class="quotes">
    <p class=quote>&quot Open design, particularly in regards to <span>digital hardware and software</span> heralds new possibilities for artists, scholars and interested citizens to engage more fully in a simultaneously conceptual and material critique of technologies and information systems in society. &quot
    </p><br>
    <p>Nowadays our daily lifes are profoudly influenced by and closely related to digital hardware and software. However in the traditional industries, these works are mostly developed by the expertises, which means the further impact and implication of their developments, reflecting on the society, might be despised, or even neglected. The joint effort from multi-disciplinaries and the wider public, can reassess the previews works - trying to erase bias, inequality - which may led to better design in our digital era.
    </p><br><br><br>
    <p class=quote>&quot I call this work ‘critical making’ in order to highlight the reconnection of two modes of engagement with the world that are typically held separate: critical thinking, traditionally understood as conceptually and linguistically based, and physical ‘making’, goal-based material work. I see this as a necessary integration for a variety of reasons: first, as a way of overcoming the ‘brittle’ and overly structural sense of technologies that often exists in critical social science literature... &quot
    </p><br>
    <p> Just highly agree with reason1!! 
    </p><br><br><br>
    <p class=quote>&quot What differentiates critical making is its attention to the interwoven social and technical aspects of modern life – what theorists call the <span>socio-technical</span>  – rather than being primarily about technical expertise or functional knowledge about the natural world. &quot
    </p><br>
    <p>When I started to know something about critical design and speculative design, I tried to make some physical props to build up my scenarios. However, as these design being "dealing with the aesthetics of the use of new technologies in the context of electric"(from Introduction to Speculative Design Practice), seems that it is difficult for us to put technologies aside. Trying to use them as a medium/approach in the design practices seems becoming inevitably important.
